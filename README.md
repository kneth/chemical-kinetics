# A brief introduction to chemical kinetics

In 1996 I was teaching chemical kinetics as part of a physical
chemistry course at Roskilde University. I found the textbook's
presentation of the topic less optimal for undergraduate students.

As a result of my observations, I decided to write a short text titled
"Lecture Notes in Chemical Kinetics". Years ago I lost the original
LaTeX files but in November 2020 I recovered a PostScript file of the
text.

In this repository you find a reconstruction of the text. I publish it
in the hope it can be useful for both undergraduate students and
university teachers.

## Changes to the original text

First, I have changed the title. I am not affiliated with any university, and
I don't teach, it is not lecture notes anymore. It has become my
humble contribution to chemistry.

Moreover, I have corrected spelling errors. Both spell checkers and my English
have improved over the years!
