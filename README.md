# A brief introduction to chemical kinetics

In 1996 I was teaching chemical kinetics as part of a physical
chemistry course at Roskilde University. I found the textbook's
presentation of the topic less optimal for undergraduate students.

As a result of my observations, I decided to write a short text titled
"Lecture Notes in Chemical Kinetics". Years ago I lost the original
LaTeX files but in November 2020 I recovered a PostScript file of the
text.

In this repository you find a reconstruction of the text. I publish it
in the hope it can be useful for both undergraduate students and
university teachers.
