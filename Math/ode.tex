\chapter{Ordinary differential equations}
\label{chap:ode}

Ordinary differential equations occur everywhere in physics and
chemistry (yes, even in biology and economy). In chemical kinetics we
are only interested in first-order equations, and therefore this
appendix only reviews this topic.

The appendix should not be regarded as a complete tutorial on
differential equations. It is recommended that you study a thorough
math textbook on the topic \eg \cite{kreyszig}.

In the theory of differential equations there exists one important
theorem. It says that the equation

\begin{equation}
  \diff{x}{t} = f(x, t)
\end{equation}

has a unique solution when one specifies the initial conditions \ie
a value for $x$ at one value of $t$.
