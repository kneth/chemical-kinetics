\chapter*{Preface}

Chemical kinetics is regarded as part of physical chemistry, and
therefore it is part of any introductional course in physical
chemistry.

Despite the name, thermodynamics is a science of equilibrium \ie the
systems studied do not change with time. Chemical kinetics is
basically the opposite -- here we study the change of the
concentration of a species during a chemical reaction.

The present text is about chemical kinetics - as hinted in the
title. The intended reader is a undergraduate student in
chemistry. Chemical kinetics - as physical chemistry in general -
draws a lot from mathematics and the essential mathematics used in
this text is explained or outlined in an appendix.

The motivation for writing this text is, that the author has not yet
found a good introductional textbook on chemical kinetics. Any
contemporary textbook on physical chemistry has a chapter or two, but
often they are either too badly written or too simple. There exist
some textbooks covering only chemical kinetics, but they are for
either advanced undergraduate or graduate students.
